# Project 3

# Becker Grounds Management

Group Project #3

In this assignment, we worked in a group of 4 people. WE had to build and design a full-stack web application using everything that we have learned in the class. The application had to be made using React. 

Our application is a website for a landscaping company. We have three different sections of the application available. The first one is for the Admin: the admin will be able to access all of the database and user information available, manage it, and update as necessary. The second one is the employee login: the employee will be able to select the property that they are working on, the date when they worked on it, and add comments or information about the property. The third section is for the client: the client will be able to see information about their property, add comments, and select when they want the service done.
