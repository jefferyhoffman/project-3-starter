## Welcome
In this repo our team collaborated creating an e-commerce application, a brand of high-end luxury designed watches on our application developed in React.js
The user is able to view a collections page of the brand and can easily add it to their shopping cart once they log-in. If the user has never visit our site, they have the pleasure of registering. The user may also view and update their personal profile for a convenient User Experience. The collections page is full of products seeded from our MySQL database. The shopping cart adds the quanity and totaled price for the user, once the checkout form is complete the user receives a Thank-You For Shopping note.
